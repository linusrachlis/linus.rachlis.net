Dear members of the Board of Governors of York University,

I'm a Liberal Arts & Professional Studies alum, and here's why I
cancelled my monthly donation to York last year.

In October 2015, Canadian billionaire Victor Dahdaleh made a $20-million
donation to York that will fund a new academic building, to be named
after him. In May 2016, the [Toronto
Star][torstar]
and the [CBC][cbc]
completed their joint investigation into the Panama Papers, a giant
collection of leaked documents relating to offshore companies. The
investigation confirmed long-standing allegations against Dahdaleh: that
he had been a central figure in an international corruption scandal,
using shell companies and bribes to suck US$400 million out of the
aluminum industry from 1989-2009.

I would have expected these revelations to change York's plans. Instead,
at the June 2016 convocation, York bestowed an honorary doctor of laws
on Dahdaleh. He addressed the graduating class, encouraging them to be
good citizens like him. York President Mamdouh Shoukri [shrugged off
questions][cbc2]
of Dahdaleh's suitability as a role model.

Continuing York's friendship with Dahdaleh was a serious mistake. You're
the leaders of an influential Canadian institution, welcoming unfair
markets and economic instability. Corruption stories may not move
people, but Dahdaleh's actions of foreign bribery, artificial markups,
and money laundering are illegal for good reason. They damage economies,
and ordinary people suffer the consequences, while billionaires like him
leap to their next perch.

In October 2016, after [criticism](http://www.excal.on.ca/dahdaleh-senate-meeting/)
from York Senate member and economics Professor Ricardo Grinspun,
Shoukri pointed out that Dahdaleh has never been convicted of a crime.
From 2008-2014, Dahdaleh successfully fought a U.S. fraud lawsuit as
well as U.K. criminal charges of corruption and money laundering, both
related to this corruption scheme. [His
defence][torstar]
in the criminal case was based on century-old legislation around bribery
of foreign officials, under which it didn't count if the foreign
government (in this case, Bahrain) approved of the bribe. [Mistakes
made](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/victor-dahdaleh-corruption-case-billionaires-fraud-trial-collapses-after-key-sfo-witnesses-refuse-to-8995972.html)
by the U.K. Serious Fraud Office, as well as witnesses refusing to
testify, contributed to his acquittal. The U.K. fixed the outdated law
in 2010, too late to catch Dahdaleh.

So far, Dahdaleh has not been charged based on the new evidence in the
Panama Papers, which includes emails confirming his identity as the
middleman who facilitated millions of dollars in bribes paid by Alcoa, a
global aluminum giant. In 2014, Alcoa pleaded guilty to corruption
charges and paid US$384 million in fines.

The above should make clear the difference between legal and moral
guilt. It's obvious Dahdaleh should not go to jail unless convicted by
the imperfect machinations of our legal systems. But it's just as
obvious he is not fit to be honoured by York, nor is it ethical to take
his money. York has a responsibility to hold its friends to a higher
standard than "not guilty".

Yes, the decline in public funding is hard for all universities. But
while $20 million is large for a private donation, it's a morsel of
York's $1-billion [annual
revenue](http://www.yorku.ca/finance/documents/Financial_Statements_April_30_2016.pdf).
Students themselves are the largest single contributor, paying $520
million in tuition fees last year. The province of Ontario provided
[$305
million](https://www.ontario.ca/data/operating-grants-colleges-and-universities)
for 2012-13 (the most recent data available). For two years in a row,
York has posted surpluses on the same scale as Dahdaleh's donation
($19.9 million for 2014-15, and $23.3 million for 2015-16). Refusing or
returning his donation was feasible.

Moreover, cutting ties with Dahdaleh would have been best for long-term
revenue. That $305 million from the people of Ontario didn't come from
some abstract notion of stimulating the economy. That's the conventional
argument for increased funding for universities, and it doesn't work --
[the decline
continues](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/where-do-canada-s-post-secondary-dollars-go-1.2994476).
The public will want to fund York if you can lead us to a more equal,
sustainable future where we recognise ourselves better in our public
policy. A healthy democracy needs leadership from universities on the
murkiest ethical questions.

York does this on some level, with a variety of humanities programs and
symposia such as October's [Re-imagining
Refuge][refuge].
But if this productive ethical questioning doesn't go straight to the
top, then it's limited to the status of hobby. It should be York's chief
occupation, but your continued friendship with Dahdaleh shows it isn't.
As you abandon ethical questions at the executive level, public funding
becomes vestigial, and will eventually wither completely. Without public
funding, a university is not a university. It's a private school for
management elites, a corporate research lab, a think tank.

Last spring, as two reputable, national publications confirmed
Dahdaleh's wrongdoing, you had an opportunity to fight this trend. It
would have been inconvenient, but you would have been clearly in the
right. As you consider who your next president will be, I urge you to
choose someone who will do better. Canada needs your leadership, and you
need our commitment. *Tentanda via.*

Sincerely,

Linus Rachlis
