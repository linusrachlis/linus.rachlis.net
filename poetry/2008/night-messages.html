      <h2>Night Messages</h2>

      <p>
      A space winks open in the night<br>
with me inside, sitting up in bed.<br>
<br>
I watch your closed face,<br>
your musty breaths on my arm<br>
like something I&#8217;m stealing.<br>
<br>
My empty mind<br>
begins abstracting the night<br>
and there is not even the sound of a car<br>
on the main road, no human intent<br>
on going somewhere,<br>
taking care of something.<br>
<br>
In the next room, the fridge<br>
groans for a few minutes<br>
and on the edge of hearing,<br>
low frog calls<br>
bounce around the lake<br>
like a pinball game. Your mind is elsewhen, <br>
your body just a cell going about its business.<br>
The frogs and the fridge go about theirs too<br>
but I have snagged<br>
on something.<br>
<br>
Unable to see objects as I&#8217;m used to,<br>
losing my train of thought,<br>
I pull on sweatpants.<br>
It seems to take centuries<br>
for them to evolve to fit my legs.<br>
When I open the front door<br>
<br>
the moon<br>
<br>
it&#8217;s taken over, conducting the night.<br>
I wander for a time, and each tree and rock<br>
looks enraptured, brightly whispering to it<br>
but when I stare, they hush themselves<br>
as if caught. The night becomes<br>
this feeling: not knowing<br>
what the renewed silence<br>
has just covered over.<br>
<br>
When I turn back to the cabin, a stag<br>
stands mutely on the doorstep.<br>
<br>
He doesn&#8217;t move as I softly<br>
retrace my steps over tree roots<br>
until I can see the fur on his chest<br>
rising and falling.<br>
<br>
This hunted, naked thing<br>
is conscious every second<br>
of what he is; each second<br>
beats, and then<br>
is a second less.<br>
<br>
Together we enter that trans-<br>
personal space from which I usually<br>
avert my eyes. I am<br>
<br>
becoming vast,<br>
<br>
more&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; than I am supposed to be.<br>
<br>
More<br>
and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I get the sense<br>
more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that his dark eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have been with me longer than<br>
<br>
I can remember.<br>
<br>
They are a lake from which<br>
I am just now surfacing,<br>
in a spot of moonlight.<br>
<br>
My tongue thickens<br>
into tree bark. Speech becomes<br>
just a campfire creation story<br>
I heard as a child.<br>
As the spaces between thoughts<br>
stretch longer, the moon&#8217;s whisper<br>
implies what it really is.<br>
Its phases flip by as I search its face,<br>
seeing time as a rock does<br>
before it sets.<br>
<br>
After the glow fades<br>
from his neck, the stag<br>
drops my gaze and lifts his hoof<br>
to take a step, as if it must be<br>
correctly placed.<br>
<br>
I have taken part in night&#8217;s conspiracy<br>
and have been heard.<br>
What I said, and who said it to me before&#8212;<br>
<br>
I am a knowing thing, and so<br>
I cannot know.
