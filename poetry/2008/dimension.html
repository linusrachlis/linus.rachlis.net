      <h2>Dimension</h2>

      <p>
      A little refraction sharpens<br>
those layers of trees<br>
into precise retinal shadowplay.<br>
<br>
The branches waver minutely, each in a glass slide<br>
and project their shimmers on the ground.<br>
It&#8217;s been too long since I last<br>
ran into the picture.<br>
<br>
At first, as the plane<br>
approaches in the greater, empty distance<br>
it simply slides, like a paper plane<br>
that a child is dragging straight along the wall.<br>
<br>
Then, without moving,<br>
I notice it&#8217;s actually carving through<br>
obliquely<br>
the sound trailing<br>
a few seconds behind it,<br>
the sound of a skyscraper of graphite<br>
drawn smoothly across a mountain face,<br>
echoing<br>
though only empty sky lies behind.<br>
<br>
It stabs through the world<br>
coming toward me<br>
then rising away<br>
and so does every person and car,<br>
unable to move without violence,<br>
tearing the canvas.<br>
<br>
I sit frozen in place<br>
parallel<br>
to nothing.
