      <h2>Splashing</h2>

      <p>
      In the dim light<br>
I try to catch the poet&#8217;s ideas<br>
as he projects them over heads and tables<br>
but they dissolve into the air like smoke.<br>
The poem slides around,<br>
consonants snap, vowels spill.<br>
<br>
I find I&#8217;ve become a screen<br>
on which the overhead words play<br>
but at the wrong distance,<br>
so that huge letterforms cover me at random.<br>
Serifs alight on my face and hands, and ascenders<br>
escape through my scalp.<br>
<br>
I&#8217;ve become a room<br>
in which a child lies down<br>
after dinner, full-bellied,<br>
the lamplight splashing over<br>
the sofa cushions and his shoulders.<br>
The adults linger in the dining room,<br>
their chatter drifting in.<br>
<br>
Their words each have different weights<br>
and shapes and will not be ushered smoothly<br>
by any of the currents washing through<br>
the canyons of his mind.<br>
The gullies run softly over<br>
<br>
but he recognises the conversation<br>
and what it means:<br>
what he is becoming<br>
by listening.
