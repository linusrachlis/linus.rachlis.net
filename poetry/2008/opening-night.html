      <h2>Opening Night</h2>

      <p>
      As you make your way back-stage<br>
you may occasionally glance out<br>
at the house<br>
<br>
and find someone else<br>
in your old seat,<br>
I pretending with them<br>
as I used to with you<br>
that there is no back-stage.<br>
<br>
You understand<br>
if I didn&#8217;t do this,<br>
it would turn into one of those<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;experimental theatres.<br>
We&#8217;d lose most of our business, at least<br>
the kind we wanted.<br>
<br>
But you followed me back here.<br>
I invited you, it&#8217;s true<br>
and then like a house guest<br>
looking for something to do<br>
you wandered from mantel piece<br>
to painting to portrait,<br>
and you&#8217;re part of the production now.<br>
<br>
You know the way<br>
the same steps across the stage<br>
the same entrances and exits<br>
change when performed,<br>
not until the third or fourth time<br>
becoming the way you&#8217;ll remember them.<br>
<br>
And the way<br>
you wanted to banish<br>
the thoughts of being watched<br>
but instead learned to love<br>
the rhythms we blocked out<br>
and the things you could pronounce<br>
while in costume.<br>
<br>
Loved how<br>
in the glare of stage lights<br>
it was like just talking to the dark,<br>
the same dark every actor talks to<br>
that can never be filled.<br>
<br>
Although you love me<br>
you acquire an actor&#8217;s maturity:<br>
you get used to talking out,<br>
to sharpened motions<br>
that mime what is less simple.
