      <h2>Woke up without my wallet</h2>

      <p>
      Finally found myself<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a place where<br>
&#8220;words are transformative&#8221;<br>
again.<br>
<br>
For a time we forgot all those<br>
dead ones, that in general<br>
are a good idea to<br>
keep in your back pocket.<br>
<br>
With our other friends<br>
the distance had made the game for keeps;<br>
meanwhile, we tried<br>
each other&#8217;s eyes<br>
as in a mirror.<br>
<br>
As night became just more day<br>
each breath had me wondering<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;high up as we were<br>
if I could breathe a little less,<br>
make it the last.
