      <h2>Standing Orders</h2>

      <p>
      A man just needs a few things.<br>
I had no more moon or sun to wind my thoughts.<br>
The recycled air I breathed<br>
was like old laundry.<br>
It pressed me in<br>
for fear of losing itself outside.<br>
<br>
I drank; I slept<br>
curled and clothed<br>
seeing what I could.<br>
<br>
I toasted all the victories<br>
I knew.<br>
<br>
Each day was a passing theatre<br>
of those who knew no better.<br>
I laughed as I tossed back<br>
and burned my cuts to freshness.<br>
<br>
Each night, sitting where I could<br>
the floor swelling<br>
rising gingerly<br>
to meet me, her lap<br>
her thighs<br>
these arms, waiting.<br>
<br>
Like a pendulum, this swing between<br>
was me<br>
most myself in another<br>
little death.<br>
<br>
I stand on your threshold now,<br>
my indecisions spread about me.<br>
My breath smells of them<br>
they peer out of my eyes<br>
and shuffle with each foot fall.<br>
<br>
They follow me like royal robes<br>
ridiculous.<br>
<br>
They follow us<br>
like marauders through the void.<br>
Help me cut out this centre<br>
of gravity and lay it<br>
on the table between us.<br>
<br>
We&#8217;re all on the run together<br>
and even the poorest one among us<br>
must throw the last of his firewood<br>
on the common flame.
