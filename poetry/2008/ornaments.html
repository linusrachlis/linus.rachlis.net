      <h2>Ornaments</h2>

      <p>
      Some people&#8217;s names are not names,<br>
but have come to denote<br>
periods of history.<br>
<br>
They preside inside of us<br>
like books on oak shelves.<br>
A perfect layer of dust<br>
betrays their ill-studiedness,<br>
ornaments.<br>
<br>
Curious children have peeled off their labels,<br>
then, the glue long dry, we left them off.<br>
<br>
Cracking one open<br>
reveals pages of full stops,<br>
<br>
each marked a little too darkly<br>
while absent-mindedly<br>
waiting for the right sentence to attach.
