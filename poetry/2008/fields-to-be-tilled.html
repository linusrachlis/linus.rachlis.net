      <h2>Fields to be Tilled</h2>

      <p>
      If what&#8217;s attractive are contradictions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &#8212;changes in direction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; surprising harmonies&#8212;<br>
<br>
must I choose between two kinds of love?<br>
<br>
The one that hangs<br>
on the balance of who I am,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; narrower and narrower;<br>
the other<br>
that creates the balance?<br>
<br>
Who could fall in love with a monk,<br>
who has already given himself up,<br>
the last blood running<br>
from his heart like warm water,<br>
ready to rejoin the sea?<br>
<br>
Desire requires lives ahead,<br>
fields to be tilled,<br>
time to be filled:<br>
<br>
undiscovered<br>
countries.
