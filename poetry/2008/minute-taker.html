      <h2>Minute Taker</h2>

      <p>
      Give psychology its due<br>
but inner work is more about<br>
astronomy<br>
<br>
the study of the universe<br>
<br>
universes<br>
in general<br>
<br>
laws, discoverable<br>
movements, inexorable<br>
some as small<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;as a dog&#8217;s bark<br>
<br>
others vast<br>
the collision of galaxies:<br>
<br>
dogs mix with stars,<br>
barks with atmospheres.<br>
But the sounds are mere fiction<br>
at the edge of the churning matter.<br>
<br>
Although I know there&#8217;s no sense<br>
in deciding which things<br>
are too small to carry<br>
<br>
I begin anyway<br>
in the past<br>
trying to catch up.<br>
<br>
The gases expand<br>
each second<br>
moving less.<br>
<br>
Time becomes uncountable.<br>
Still I count.
