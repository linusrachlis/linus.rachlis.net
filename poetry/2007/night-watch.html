      <h2>Night Watch</h2>

      <p>
      So much must conspire to rest this body and mind.<br>
Cocktail hour: the darkness circulates.<br>
A potion, grudgingly taken, tumbling limbs;<br>
the mind, a heavy beast, lays down its horns.<br>
<br>
Takes its nightly intermission inside<br>
a pool of absence neither black nor white,<br>
wraps itself up tight and waits, open&#8212;<br>
the water rises quick from under noticing.<br>
<br>
Insulated, electrolysed mind,<br>
deserted as its army buoys free,<br>
can breathe underwater in its dreams,<br>
touch all its moments<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;there among the seaweed.<br>
<br>
Old captain having sunk unto the depths,<br>
next stands, dons the cap,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;skims the letter that was left.
