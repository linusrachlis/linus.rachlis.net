      <h2>Things that are red &amp; good</h2>

      <p>
      With icy ears<br>
your head leans<br>
heavy against the bricks.<br>
<br>
Vision afloat<br>
cider in hand<br>
the hour&#8217;s shovelling<br>
a warm chest weight;<br>
the Christmas lights need taking down.<br>
<br>
Cranberries in the fireflicker that night,<br>
their dried wrinkles between your fingers as the blood returns.<br>
<br>
In the morning<br>
signs of yesterday<br>
loosening embers that still burn.
