      <h2>The end falls out on you</h2>

      <p>
      In ancient Rome they plunged their hands in.<br>
Washing off the blood.<br>
Eating apples and spectating the stench.<br>
<br>
Nowadays I put down my spoon till it&#8217;s over.<br>
<br>
Yet out of my science I envision a God, and hope<br>
he expects that we&#8217;ll all make the worst mistakes<br>
right before we grow up.<br>
<br>
Nowadays when we choose to be stupid, it makes us principled.<br>
<br>
Only certain of us retained the ability<br>
to burn cities to the ground<br>
and eat an apple.<br>
<br>
What do the rest of us get?<br>
a persistent toothache from our hidden carnivorous ways;<br>
a hand-held heart for all those other times, which have become every time;<br>
a broadband connection to images of every unbidden kind at a speed without precedent;<br>
multifaceted covariant bilingual extra-ordinary penpersonship;<br>
the ability to smirk uncontrollably while striding through a public place,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then later forget why.<br>
<br>
We&#8217;ve cut all our ribbons.<br>
The ragged edges flail in the wind, caressing briefly at the old incision.<br>
No one watches.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, I do my apple-eating at my desk, where the juice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; though spattering uncontrollably,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will not return home till all this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comes crumbling down.<br>
<br>
Still, can we be saved?<br>
We have found moments of true union, even though afterwards the priest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goes out back for a smoke break and the poet swears artlessly in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heavy traffic on the way home from the reading. She just wants a shower<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and that leftover stirfry, and refuses to be observant any more until she&#8217;s<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spectated some TV and slept a few hours.<br>
<br>
Peeking through the skinbag, the animal,<br>
meek and furtive.<br>
The Romans would not understand.<br>
<br>
You were too young to remember:<br>
when the first circle gathered<br>
apples were a sacrament.<br>
The whiffs sent messages.<br>
That was a circle I could understand.<br>
You know?<br>
Just people. In a circle.<br>
<br>
The curves apparent;<br>
the meat killed and cooked in the centre for all to see.<br>
If a single person broke away<br>
the fire would surely flicker out.<br>
<br>
Now each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; deeper circle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; finer fabric<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; vaster still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; till<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; no single<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; of eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; can see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; the curve.
