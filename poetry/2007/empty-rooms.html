      <h2>Empty Rooms</h2>

      <p>
      <i>Bang.<br>
Is always followed by a period.</i><br>
<br>
It&#8217;s only a decision the first time:<br>
a new colour on your hands<br>
afraid the stars will sing you to hell<br>
<br>
but soon it soaks through your wrists<br>
your arms&#8212;a tree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; with the time-earned right to reach out:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; those standing beneath you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; dread any breeze;<br>
soon you descend red-faced and fear no hell&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you provide it.<br>
<br>
The trigger becomes part of you like a boot heel<br>
stomping blindly<br>
on a pack of sick dogs.<br>
<br>
Those left standing<br>
in the rooms that aren&#8217;t empty<br>
keep licking, like a prayer,<br>
at that raw little corner<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; that never quite stays down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; when you smooth it out<br>
but the wind has already picked up.<br>
<br>
The feeling of what you&#8217;ve done<br>
drains from you early,<br>
hardens into a reflex in your finger,<br>
hardens your ears.<br>
<br>
As they yelp<br>
a soft bell rings.
