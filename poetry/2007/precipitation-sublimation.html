      <h2>Precipitation, Sublimation</h2>

      <p>
      Your folks<br>
your friends<br>
even your foes<br>
all saw it before you did:<br>
the first time you fell into a conversation<br>
the first time you rose to an occasion,<br>
<br>
not exactly<br>
changing,<br>
realising after the fact<br>
how few first times were left,<br>
how they were all gathering skyward,<br>
somewhere far-off and safe,<br>
not exactly<br>
changing.<br>
<br>
So pick an attitude<br>
take some strides.<br>
<br>
These mornings will fall<br>
while afternoons rise<br>
<br>
&#8212;the bottom of a pail is broken through&#8212;<br>
<br>
wow<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that&#8217;s bright blue.<br>
<br>
Looks good on<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;you.
