      <h2>Rarefaction</h2>

      <p>
      I feel religious<br>
sometimes<br>
on aeroplanes.<br>
<br>
It&#8217;s the urgent take-off<br>
pounding and pounding<br>
pure passion winning out<br>
for once<br>
<br>
then afterwards the closeness to space<br>
a hundred pairs of feet<br>
tip-toeing around the edge of reality.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I imagine that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;God notices<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;each step<br>
so I must notice, too.<br>
<br>
What story will I tell<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of these high cotton fields?<br>
Of ice threading across the window<br>
ears popping in the expanding space<br>
the explosions on which we ride<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;smoothing out behind us?<br>
<br>
What sort of story is here, the wings barely swaying<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in the sun as I sit, sipping?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Close the window shade.<br>
We&#8217;re losing time.<br>
<br>
And close the lingering space between:<br>
touch my face<br>
tell me I&#8217;m still here.<br>
<br>
Touch-down:<br>
just a little kiss.
