      <div style="width: 23em;">
my neck aches i&#8217;ve had my cheek pressed up to the window since we took off trying to see behind us that&#8217;s where the really astonishing part of the sunset is and the angle is just right as the cloud layers catch fire we tear through them like pegasus riding a supernova and it&#8217;s the biggest space i could possibly imagine flying through even after all that star trek because now i can see midnight and dusk in the same glance as if the world were a clock that means less and less the farther away i get so hanging above it i feel more and more part of another species and this being my tenth or eleventh time flying the reality of it is starting to set which means there will always be an empty space like this inside my mind with just enough thin air to suck on and all the long roads leading to it like cirrus clouds and the sun perpetually setting or rising somewhere there&#8217;s too much space there&#8217;s room enough for something but what?
