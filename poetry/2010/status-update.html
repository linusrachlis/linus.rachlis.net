      <p>
      Linus<br>
wants you to know that<br>
even though my identity sits here distilled<br>
like some computer file in a directory listing<br>
name, thumbnail, last modified, last accessed, file size<br>
randomly accessible from anywhere anytime<br>
I am a particular person.<br>
<br>
If you run into me in the street, it is still special<br>
even if the street is not.<br>
True, you can invite me to your party with a click<br>
and I may even come<br>
but might feel awkward<br>
and unsure if I&#8217;m really wanted<br>
and you can&#8217;t beat the spontaneity of<br>
hey<br>
we&#8217;re here now<br>
fancy some coffee?<br>
<br>
My profile is in roughly the same format as everyone else&#8217;s<br>
the only differences being the way I coloured it in,<br>
letting you ignore the fact<br>
that I was created from the ground up&#8212;<br>
I am an improvised person.<br>
<br>
I am more of a person than some, and less than others<br>
Smarter than some, duller than others<br>
My heart is bigger than some, and smaller than others&#8217;<br>
My angst is not a point on an emotigraph<br>
or cause for a status update<br>
It&#8217;s the meaning of my life<br>
balancing on a question<br>
<br>
You can message me without getting in touch with me<br>
although hey, messages are nice, while<br>
I tell myself I can shapeshift<br>
into just a face in a book<br>
<br>
for now, the consummate utilitarian<br>
until taking flight into the future<br>
when I&#8217;m ready<br>
<br>
My wings are broader than some, and frailer than others<br>
though we all wait to take flight.
