      <h2>Can I See</h2>

      <p>
      I can see your lion&#8217;s eye<br>
	    as the sprawling sun makes your iris gleam.<br>
	    <br>
	    That soft brown shows its true self:<br>
	    a wild orange starburst<br>
	    with acid algae bloom. I intuit<br>
	    <br>
	    how your eye feels from the inside.<br>
	    I see things even you don&#8217;t know&#8212;<br>
	    you don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re a lion.<br>
	    <br>
	    The pupil, though curled up tight,<br>
	    is still pure black, omniscient<br>
	    yet obscure.<br>
	    <br>
	    Your moment of clarity<br>
	    has an invisible core.
