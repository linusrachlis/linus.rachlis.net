      <h2>Planetarium</h2>

      <p>
      A swath of the moon&#8217;s surface hangs<br>
in the dusk, a fruit<br>
the air is swollen<br>
enough to bear.<br>
<br>
The sun&#8217;s angle brightens the sky<br>
from the inside, like eyelids,<br>
the planet a jewel as always but<br>
only now giving that special<br>
angular wink.<br>
<br>
The walls come close enough<br>
for an echo, but still if I speak softly<br>
my words don&#8217;t come back,<br>
stay warm in my ear.<br>
<br>
The novel of the world<br>
becomes a short story<br>
<br>
and the sun is really setting on<br>
its broader themes, invisible<br>
to its protagonist, felt only<br>
as some kind of gravity, the sense<br>
<br>
of falling<br>
around a star.<br>
Knowing it is already eluding<br>
him again.
