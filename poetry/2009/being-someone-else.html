      <h2>Being someone else is something else</h2>

      <p>
      Mostly all I see of her<br>
is a thin blanket kept aloft<br>
by her up-stretched arms,<br>
<br>
threadbare.<br>
I&#8217;m in love with her<br>
<br>
because every so often<br>
the light shines underneath:<br>
a naked child forgetting herself<br>
with bright eyes, all attention upwards.
