      <h2>Urban Unplanning</h2>

      <p>
      Don&#8217;t send me to live<br>
in the suburbs of your life<br>
but&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; maybe a place away<br>
from that downtown core. Set me up<br>
<br>
in one of those unassuming neighbourhoods<br>
where people in little ground-floor stores<br>
make a living selling necessities,<br>
people who don&#8217;t mind<br>
that no one else has ever heard of them.<br>
Where you can be sure whether that&#8217;s really<br>
what&#8217;s-her-face sitting in the next booth<br>
texting someone.<br>
<br>
Don&#8217;t let me come to need<br>
the pleasure of distance<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that seems nice because so simple<br>
taken in systems that just work,<br>
but do no work.<br>
<br>
If I stay in your suburbs too long<br>
I may no longer want to know your heart<br>
get my shoes wet when your streets flood<br>
or hang out in ill-defined back alleys.<br>
<br>
So let my car be totalled<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or impounded<br>
and my ttc tickets lost or stolen<br>
<br>
I&#8217;ll have to get on my bike and coast<br>
down toward the lake<br>
where those same ideas<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;about roads and traffic regulation<br>
first draped themselves everywhere<br>
in naive rumples.<br>
<br>
Draw me jostling along the changing terrain<br>
through concrete attempts<br>
becoming their own museums<br>
and let&#8217;s start the urban unplanning.
