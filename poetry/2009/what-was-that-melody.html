      <h2>What was that melody</h2>

      <p>
      In the hall between karaoke rooms<br>
the musical undertow:<br>
it will do<br>
for silence.<br>
<br>
To my softened mind<br>
every gesture of ours<br>
fills with warm consequence;<br>
every flit of my eyes<br>
a song on someone&#8217;s balcony,<br>
if you&#8217;re listening.<br>
We hop between established melody<br>
and improvised bends.<br>
<br>
This thought keeps us from parting just yet:<br>
whatever note you make the last<br>
becomes perfect.<br>
Becomes the whole.
